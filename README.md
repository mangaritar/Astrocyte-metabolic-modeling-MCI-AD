# Astrocyte-metabolic-modeling-MCI-AD
Transcriptome-based metabolic modeling of human astrocytes in MCI and Alzheimer's disease. Includes condition-specific GEMs and transcriptomic integration scripts.

Welcome! This repository contains the code and data behind our project:
“Transcriptome-Informed Metabolic Modeling Reveals Astrocyte-Specific Vulnerabilities in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease Progression.”

We use gene expression data to build and simulate metabolic models of human astrocytes in four conditions:

Control
Incipient MCI
Moderate MCI
Severe MCI / AD

What’s in this repo?
This project includes:
Four genome-scale metabolic models of human astrocytes
RNA-seq expression data for each condition
Scripts to integrate gene expression and simulate models

Quick Start
Clone this repo and open it in MATLAB
Make sure you have the COBRA Toolbox installed

Why this matters
Astrocytes play a key role in brain metabolism.
This project helps uncover how their metabolism is altered during the progression of MCI and Alzheimer’s Disease, and highlights potential metabolic vulnerabilities that could be targeted in future research.
